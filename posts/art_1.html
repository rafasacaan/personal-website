                    Victor Vasarely was born in April 9th, 1906. He abandoned his medical studies to pursue traditional academic painting. 
                    Later, in the 1930s, he transitioned to working as a graphic designer and poster artist, 
                    where he began combining <span class="underline_">patterns with organic imagery</span>. He had two sons.<br>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Art and science, two ways of expressing the human mind, seem to have an affinity with each other. One produces new symbols, the other uses them. They complete and fertilize each other."
                    </blockquote>
                    He worked as a graphic artist and as a creative consultant at advertising agencies.<br>
                    He also got to design the cover for <span class="underline_">David BowieÂ´s second album.</span><br>
